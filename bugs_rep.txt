BUGS:
echo abc > grep | echo abc	# doesn't execute "echo abc"
< in cat | cat
< in cat | < in cat

Fixed:
sleep 100 | exit 42
cat /dev/random | head -c 100 | wc -c
echo abc | cat /dev/random | head
echo abc | echo def | cat /dev/random | head
pwd | - | << lol
pwd | cat
< in cat; < in cat; < in cat 	# ; means multiline
