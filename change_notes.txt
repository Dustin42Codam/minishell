All the changes I've done so far on the lexer branch:

-	added shell_notes.txt which describes the plan for the parser

-	added more debug options in the makefile
	make valgrind	->	make re + instant valgrind execution for full leak checking
					-> note:	gnl has still reachable bytes.
								maybe will replace gnl with another function
	make debug_1	->	compiles only with "-g" flag
	make debug_2	->	compiles with "-g" flag and -Wall -Werror -Wextra

	if compiling with "make debug_2" all tokens will be printed out after a line input

-	added new files:
	read_line.c		->	readded the old read_line() functions to read input byte by byte
	tokenizer.c		->	root file for the new tokenizer
	tokenizer_utils.c ->	subfunctions for tokenizer
	init_data		->	initializes data for new struct
	parse_astree.c	->	root file for building abstract syntax tree
	parse_*.c		->	contain subfunctions for the AST parser
	astree_utils.c	->	utilities for building/deleting tree nodes inside the AST


-	changes in files:
	main.c			->	added data struct which holds the input line received from gnl
	minishell.h		->	added some more structs
	get_next_line	->	removed get_next_line because it is shitty
